    Canvas lets us draw shapes on our web page-->

      var x = 60;
      var y = 80;

      //Next we want to set up some controls so that we can move our  circle around
      //We'll use the arrow keys to move UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT

      //How do we make them true, When do we make them true??
      //We need to make a function that keeps track of which button is being pushed,
      //Then we need change the correect variable accordingly

      //when their button is no longer being pushed
      function keyUp(e) {
