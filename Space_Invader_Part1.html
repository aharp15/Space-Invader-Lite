    <!--Create a Canvas element
    Canvas lets us draw shapes on our web page-->
    <canvas id="myCanvas" height="400" width="700"></canvas>

    <!--Next we'll use some CSS to give our Canvas object some style-->
    <style>
      canvas {
        background-color: lightgrey;
        border: 2px solid;
      }
    </style>

    <!--Now we're  gonna jump into the JavaScript
    This is going to allow us to interact with the
    things that we're drawing on our Canvas-->
    <script>
      //First, we have to make variables for our canvas
      var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
      //Make a context for the canvas
      var context = canvas.getContext("2d");

      //Now we are going to use our context variable to draw a circle
        context.beginPath(); //Starts drawing
        context.arc(pX, pY, pW, 0, Math.PI * 2, false); //Creates the dimensions for our circle
        context.fillStyle = "green"; //Chooses the color for our circle
        context.fill(); //Actually fills the circle with that color
        context.closePath(); //Stops drawing

      
    
      //Next we want to set up some controls so that we can move our  circle around
      //We'll use the arrow keys to move UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT
      //We need to keep track of which keys are being pushed at what time
      //So we'll make some variables to do that
      var upPressed = false;
      var leftPressed = false;
      var rightPressed = false;
      var downPressed = false;
      //Why do we set these variables to false????
      //How do we make them true, When do we make them true??
      //We need to make a function that keeps track of which button is being pushed,
      //Then we need change the correect variable accordingly

      //Now we have our functions made, we need to tell the computer
      //to listen for them
      document.addEventListener("keydown", keyDown, false);
      document.addEventListener("keyup", keyUp, false);

      //First lets start with when someone pushes a button
      function keyDown(e) {
        //This is where we change the variables to true, because
        //their specific  button is being pushed
        if (e.key == "ArrowUp") {
          upPressed = true;
        } //Now we need to tell the computer to check for the rest of them
        if (e.key == "ArrowLeft") {
          leftPressed = true;
        }
        if (e.key == "ArrowRight") {
          rightPressed = true;
        }
        if (e.key == "ArrowDown") {
          downPressed = true;
        }
      }
      //Next we need to do something similar
      //We need to set the variables back to false,
      //when their button is no longer being pushed
      function keyUp(e) {
        //This is where we change the variables to false, because
        //their specific button is not being pushed
        if (e.key == "ArrowUp") {
          upPressed = false;
        } //Now we need to tell the computer to check for the rest of them
        if (e.key == "ArrowLeft") {
          leftPressed = false;
        }
        if (e.key == "ArrowRight") {
          rightPressed = false;
        }
        if (e.key == "ArrowDown") {
          downPressed = false;
        }
